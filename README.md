Solving the technical task for StaLogistic

To run the program you need:
* install packages from requirements.txt;
* run the main.py file

Note: 
unfortunately, I did not do the third point of task #3, because I did not understand the conditions at all: according to the second task, I must transfer the list of files to RabbitMq, but the third task says that I must merge the contents of the files. This point is not clear.
